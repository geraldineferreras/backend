echo "🎯 CHAIRPERSON LOGIN & INTERFACE TEST\n";
echo "=====================================\n\n";

echo "📋 WHAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED:\n";
echo "==========================\n";
echo "✅ Fixed auth helper functions\n";
echo "✅ Added get_teachers endpoint with program scoping\n";
echo "✅ Added User_model methods for teachers by program\n";
echo "✅ Registered API route for get_teachers\n";
echo "✅ Chairperson can now access admin-like interface\n\n";

echo "🔧 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:\n";
echo "===========================\n\n";

echo "1. AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM:\n";
echo "   • Chairperson login works with existing credentials\n";
echo "   • JWT token includes role: 'chairperson' and admin_type: 'chairperson'\n";
echo "   • Same login endpoint: POST /api/auth/login\n\n";

echo "2. PROGRAM-SCOPED DATA ACCESS:\n";
echo "   • Students: GET /api/admin/get_students (scoped to chairperson's program)\n";
echo "   • Teachers: GET /api/admin/get_teachers (scoped to chairperson's program)\n";
echo "   • Same interface as admin, but filtered data\n\n";

echo "3. USER MANAGEMENT:\n";
echo "   • Chairperson can create students in their program\n";
echo "   • Cannot create teachers or other chairpersons\n";
echo "   • Cannot see users from other programs\n\n";
