echo "✅ SUMMARY:\n";
echo "===========\n";
echo "You now have complete control over student assignments:\n";
echo "• Debug which students are assigned to Chairpersons\n";
echo "• Remove all students from a program\n";
echo "• Move students to different programs\n";
echo "• Remove specific students from programs\n";
echo "• Delete Chairpersons after removing students\n\n";
