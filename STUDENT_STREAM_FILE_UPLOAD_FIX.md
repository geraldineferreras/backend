# Student Stream Posting with File Uploads - Fix Implementation

## Problem Identified

When students post stream content with multiple files, the files weren't being displayed or processed properly. The issue was that the student stream posting API (`POST /api/student/classroom/{class_code}/stream`) only supported JSON requests and couldn't handle multipart form-data for file uploads.

## Root Cause

The original `classroom_stream_post` method in `StudentController.php` was designed to only accept JSON data with `attachment_type` and `attachment_url` fields. It lacked:

1. **Multipart form-data support** for actual file uploads
2. **File processing logic** to handle uploaded files
3. **Attachment storage** in the `stream_attachments` table
4. **Multiple file handling** capabilities

## Solution Implemented

I've enhanced the student stream posting functionality to support both JSON and multipart form-data requests, similar to the teacher implementation.

### 1. **Dual Input Support**

The method now detects the request type and handles both formats:

```php
// Check if this is a multipart request
$content_type = $this->input->get_request_header('Content-Type');
$is_multipart = $content_type && strpos($content_type, 'multipart/form-data') !== false;

if ($is_multipart) {
    // Handle multipart form-data for file uploads
    // Process files and form fields
} else {
    // Handle JSON request (existing functionality)
    $input = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);
}
```

### 2. **File Upload Processing**

For multipart requests, the method now:

- **Processes up to 5 file attachments** (`attachment_0` to `attachment_4`)
- **Handles link attachments** (`link_0` to `link_4`)
- **Generates unique filenames** with `student_stream_` prefix
- **Stores files** in `uploads/announcement/` directory
- **Validates file uploads** with proper error checking

### 3. **Attachment Storage**

Files are now properly stored using the existing attachment infrastructure:

```php
if (!empty($all_attachments)) {
    // Load StreamAttachment model
    $this->load->model('StreamAttachment_model');
    
    // Insert attachments into stream_attachments table
    $this->StreamAttachment_model->insert_multiple($post_id, $all_attachments);
    
    // Update main post for backward compatibility
    if (count($all_attachments) === 1) {
        $this->db->where('id', $post_id)->update('classroom_stream', [
            'attachment_type' => 'file',
            'attachment_url' => $all_attachments[0]['attachment_url']
        ]);
    } else {
        $this->db->where('id', $post_id)->update('classroom_stream', [
            'attachment_type' => 'multiple',
            'attachment_url' => null
        ]);
    }
}
```

### 4. **Enhanced Response Data**

The API response now includes attachment information:

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Post created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 123,
    "title": "Post Title",
    "content": "Post content",
    "attachment_type": "multiple",
    "attachment_url": null,
    "attachments_count": 3,
    "created_at": "2024-01-15 10:30:00"
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`application/controllers/api/StudentController.php`**
   - Enhanced `classroom_stream_post()` method
   - Added multipart form-data support
   - Implemented file upload processing
   - Added attachment storage logic

2. **`test_student_stream_file_upload.html`**
   - Created comprehensive test interface
   - Tests both multipart and JSON posting
   - Includes file upload functionality
   - Shows attachment information in responses

## How It Works Now

### **Multipart Form-Data Request**
```
POST /api/student/classroom/{class_code}/stream
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Form Data:
- title: "Student Post with Files"
- content: "This post has multiple attachments"
- attachment_0: [file1.pdf]
- attachment_1: [file2.jpg]
- link_0: "https://example.com"
```

### **JSON Request (Existing)**
```
POST /api/student/classroom/{class_code}/stream
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "JSON Post",
  "content": "This is a JSON post",
  "is_draft": 0
}
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. **Open the Test File**
Navigate to `test_student_stream_file_upload.html` in your browser.

### 2. **Set Authentication**
Enter your student JWT token and click "Set Token".

### 3. **Test File Uploads**
- Go to "Multipart with Files" tab
- Fill in class code, title, and content
- Select files and add link attachments
- Click "Create Post with Files"

### 4. **Expected Result**
The response should show:
- ✅ Post created successfully
- ✅ Post ID assigned
- ✅ Attachment type and count displayed
- ✅ Files properly stored and linked

## Key Benefits

1. **Full File Upload Support**: Students can now upload multiple files
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing JSON functionality preserved
3. **Consistent Experience**: Same file handling as teacher posts
4. **Proper Storage**: Files stored in dedicated attachments table
5. **Enhanced Responses**: Attachment information included in responses

## Security Considerations

1. **File Type Validation**: Accepts common file types
2. **Unique Filenames**: Prevents filename conflicts
3. **Student Authentication**: Only enrolled students can post
4. **Class Verification**: Ensures student belongs to class
5. **File Size Limits**: Respects server upload limits

## Usage Examples

### **Frontend Implementation**
```javascript
// Create post with files
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('title', 'My Post');
formData.append('content', 'Post content');
formData.append('attachment_0', fileInput.files[0]);

const response = await fetch('/api/student/classroom/J56NHD/stream', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: formData
});
```

### **Backend Processing**
The system now automatically:
1. Detects multipart requests
2. Processes file uploads
3. Stores files securely
4. Links attachments to posts
5. Updates main post metadata
6. Returns comprehensive response data

## Conclusion

Students can now create stream posts with full file upload capabilities, matching the functionality available to teachers. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while providing a robust and secure file handling system.

This fix ensures that when students post stream content with multiple files, the files are properly:
- ✅ **Uploaded** and stored securely
- ✅ **Displayed** in the stream
- ✅ **Accessible** to other users
- ✅ **Tracked** in the database
- ✅ **Managed** through the attachment system
