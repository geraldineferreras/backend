## Frontend Integration

### React/JavaScript Example
```javascript
// Fetch teacher submissions
async function getTeacherSubmissions(taskId, token) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/tasks/${taskId}/submissions`, {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching submissions:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Usage example
const submissionsData = await getTeacherSubmissions(58, teacherToken);
console.log('Task:', submissionsData.task);
console.log('Submissions:', submissionsData.submissions);
console.log('Statistics:', {
  total: submissionsData.total_submissions,
  submitted: submissionsData.submitted_count,
  graded: submissionsData.graded_count
});
```

### Displaying Student Submissions
