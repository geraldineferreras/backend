echo "=============================================\n";
echo "After updating the database:\n";
echo "1. Login again to get a fresh JWT token\n";
echo "2. The new token will contain admin_type data\n";
echo "3. Test the endpoints again\n\n";

echo "SOLUTION 3: Check Railway Deployment\n";
echo "===================================\n";
echo "Make sure Railway has deployed the latest code:\n";
